# PolyMesh

PolyMesh is a C++ library designed to implement polytopal methods on generic and possibly curved meshes in 2 or 3 dimensions. It provides a set of robust and efficient tools for building polytopal or curved meshes, generating arbitrary order quadrature rules, and constructing polynomial spaces with the possibility of enrichment.

## Modules

You should probably put some stuff here Liam.

## Getting started

To get started with PolyMesh, you can follow the installation instructions in the documentation. Once you have installed PolyMesh, you can begin using its features in your own projects. The documentation provides comprehensive information on how to use the library and its various functions.
